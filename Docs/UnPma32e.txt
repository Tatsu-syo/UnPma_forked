0.Introduction
Thank you for downloading UnPma32.dll!

This a DLL (Dynamic Link Library) to extract PepperMint star's Archiver.
It was used in CP/M and MSX-DOS and the -pm2- method can achieve
the same compression ratio as -lh5-.

UnPma32.dll is a program of Win32.
You can use this under WinXP/2000/2003/NT/ME/98(SE)/95.
I don't know if you can use this under Win32s.

UnPma32.dll is based upon Common Archiver API.
But these APIs may be changed in the future :)
